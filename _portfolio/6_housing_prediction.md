## Description 

* Trained an 85-feature machine learning model on 500,000+ housing records to predict housing prices in Cook County, Illinois
* Achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of ~$103k across a testing set of 30,000+ housing records, leveraging techniques such as feature engineering and k-fold cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and optimize model performance.
