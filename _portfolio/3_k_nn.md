## Context 

I completed this project during my freshman year at UC Berkeley, and it was my first ever introduction to machine learning classification! 

## Description 
* Developed a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier to classify movies as Thriller / Comedy

* Utilized a Bag of Words model based on movie scripts

* Selected 20 discriminative features out of 5000+ by identifying words with higher frequency differences between genres, improving efficient computation

* Trained the model on 283 data points and evaluated performance on 50 test points, achieving 80% accuracy.

### Tools
