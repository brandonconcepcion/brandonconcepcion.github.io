## What do 'spam' and 'ham' mean? 
* Spam (1) emails are unsolicited or bulk messages, often commercial in nature, while ham (0) emails are legitimate, non-spam communications.

## Description 
* The GitHub Repo for this project can be found <a href = "https://github.com/brandonconcepcion/Spam-vs-Ham/tree/main" target = "_blank">here!</a>
* Engineered a logistic regression model on a dataset of over 7,500 points, resulting in an email classifier that achieved 90% validation accuracy and an Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.9.
* Applied advanced feature engineering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality from 18 to 5 features, mitigating overfitting and ensuring 92% of legitimate (ham) emails were correctly identified and retained in the inbox.
* Enhanced model performance through GridSearch optimization across 4 hyperparameters, resulting in a 5% increase in accuracy when classifying a validation set of 835 emails.
