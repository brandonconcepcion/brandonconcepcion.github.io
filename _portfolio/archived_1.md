## Description 
* Utilized the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED) API to achieve 93% accuracy in classifying regions likely to experience any fatalities from escalating political events, aiding Doctors Without Borders to identify high-risk zones.
* Preprocessed over 2 million political events across 74 features and 180+ countries to train 2 Multilayer Perceptrons, achieving an RÂ² score of 0.76 in predicting the number of fatalities for regions with escalating political events
* Developed a Streamlit app to visualize conflict severity and fatality predictions, enhancing humanitarian safety management.

### Tools
* Streamlit
