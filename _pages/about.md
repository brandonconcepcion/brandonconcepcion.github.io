Hi! I'm Brandon Lee Concepcion, a current undergraduate third-year studying Data Science and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley.

Outside of my own academics, I'm committed to empowering students to accomplish their personal and academic ambitions, ensuring that each of my students are well-equipped with the resources they need to succeed.

My interests include Smiskis, Marvel Studios, the gym, and walking my dogs.
