Welcome to my Portfolio! This is where I highlight some of the projects I've worked on. My full catalog of projects can be found <a href = "https://github.com/brandonconcepcion" target = "_blank">here! </a>I thought it would be funny to prompt ChatGPT with descriptions of my projects, and have it return to me the images representing them. Hopefully you got a little laugh from it ðŸ˜†
